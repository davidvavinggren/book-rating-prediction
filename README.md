# Book Rating Prediction
As a part of the course Text Mining [TDDE16], I'm attempting to predict the rating a user has given a book given its review, using BERT-base. 

To run the code, first clone the project onto your own PC. Then relocate to the root of the project and run `pip install -e .` to install the `PredictRating` package. Once the package has been installed, `pytorch` has to be installed separately in order to fit your system. See `https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/` for an install command that fits your specification.
